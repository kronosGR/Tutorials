### Chapter 1 - HTML Core

#### What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
It defines the structure and content of a webpage by using a series of elements (also known as tags) that tell the browser how to display the information.
HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it uses tags to define elements within a document.

HTML documents are made up of elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. 
These elements can be nested inside one another to create complex layouts. 
Every webpage on the internet has an HTML file that serves as its foundation. 
Without HTML, there would be no way to structure content for display on the web.

HTML is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
Together, they form the core technologies of the web.

#### Syntax

In HTML, every element is composed of three main components:

1. Opening Tag: This is where an element begins, denoted by a less-than sign (`<`) followed by the element name and optional attributes, ending with a greater-than sign (`>`).

For example:
   ```html
   <p>
   ```
Here, <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph.

2. Content: This is the actual text or other elements that appear between the opening and closing tags.

`<p>This is the content of the paragraph.</p>`
3. Closing Tag: This marks the end of an element, with a forward slash (/) before the element name. For example:

`</p>`
Closing tags are required for most elements in HTML.

Some elements, known as self-closing or void elements, do not have content and do not require closing tags.
Examples include <img> and <br>.

#### Attributes
Attributes are properties that provide additional information about an element. 
They are always specified in the opening tag of an element, usually in the format attribute="value". 

For example:
`<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>`
In this case, href is an attribute with the value "https://www.example.com", which tells the browser where to navigate when the link is clicked.

Other common attributes include:
* src: Used in <img> tags to specify the image source.
* alt: Provides alternative text for images if they fail to load.
* class: Assigns a class name for CSS styling or JavaScript manipulation.
* id: Assigns a unique identifier for an element.

Attributes can also be used to control how elements behave or look on a page, such as setting the width of an image or making a button disabled.

#### HTML Intro - Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Blog Post</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Hello, HTML!</h1>

    <p>This is my first blog post where I'm practicing my HTML skills. Every web page is built on HTML, which provides the essential structure for all of the content you see.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

* The HTML code provided creates a single web page, likely for a blog post, by using fundamental HTML syntax and attributes.
It demonstrates how different elements are structured to form a complete, readable document.

* Document Structure
The code starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which declares the document type as HTML5.
The entire page is contained within the `<html>` element, which has a lang="en" attribute to specify the language as English for accessibility and SEO.
The `<head>` section contains metadata not displayed on the page, such as the character set (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`) and the viewport settings (`<meta name="viewport"...>`) for responsive design.
The `<title>` tag sets the title that appears in the browser tab. The visible content of the page is all placed within the `<body>` element.

* Elements, Syntax, and Attributes
Within the body, the code uses various elements to structure content.
The `<h1>` tag defines the main heading of the page.
 This demonstrates the core HTML syntax of an opening tag (`<h1>`), content (Hello, HTML!), and a closing tag (`</h1>`).
The `<p>` tags are used for paragraphs of text, further illustrating this fundamental syntax.

The code also effectively uses attributes to add properties to elements. 
The `<a>` (anchor) tag creates a hyperlink, and its href attribute specifies the URL of the destination page, in this case, a file named about.html within the same project. 
The `<img>` tag, a self-closing element, uses the src attribute to define the source of the image file and the alt attribute to provide a text description for screen readers or if the image fails to load. 
Finally, a title attribute on the second `<a>` tag provides extra information that appears as a tooltip when a user hovers over the link. 
The comments within the code (using ``) provide human-readable explanations of the purpose of each element.

### Chapter 2 - Essential Elements
#### a. Document Structure
##### 1. DOCTYPE html
source code - https://github.com/kronosGR/Tutorials/tree/main/HTML/2a

The document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in. For HTML5, it's simply `<!DOCTYPE html>`. 
This declaration must be the very first line of an HTML document and is case-insensitive. 
It ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode rather than quirks mode. 
While not an actual HTML element, it's crucial for proper page rendering and compatibility across different browsers.

The DOCTYPE declaration is essential because it tells the browser to use the modern HTML5 standard instead of legacy modes that might cause inconsistent rendering. 
Without it, some browsers may enter quirks mode where they try to emulate older browser behaviors.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>My Page</title></head>
<body><h1>Hello World</h1></body>
</html>
```

##### 2.  html
The root element of an HTML document. This is the parent element that contains all other elements in the page.
 Every HTML document must have one `<html>` element, and it should be the direct child of the document.
It's often called the "root" or "parent" element because all other elements are descendants of this element.

The `<html>` element can have several important attributes:
* lang: Specifies the primary language of the document content (e.g., lang="en" for English, lang="es" for Spanish)
* xml:lang: Specifies the language for XML documents (used in XHTML)
* dir: Specifies the text direction ("ltr" for left-to-right, "rtl" for right-to-left)
  
Example:
```
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

##### 3 head
The container for metadata about the document.
This section contains information about the page that is not visible to visitors, such as the title, character set, stylesheets, scripts, and other meta information.
Elements inside the `<head>` are not displayed on the web page itself but provide important information to browsers, search engines, and other web services.

Common attributes for elements within head:
* `<title>`: Contains the title of the document (shown in browser tab)
* `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the HTML document
	* charset: Specifies character encoding (e.g., charset="UTF-8")
	* name: Defines the type of metadata (description, keywords, author, viewport)
	* content: The value for the metadata defined by the name attribute
* `<link>`: Defines relationships between the document and external resources
	* rel: Relationship type (stylesheet, icon, canonical)
	* href: URL to the resource
	* type: MIME type of the linked resource
* `<script>`: Contains or references JavaScript code
	* src: URL to external script file
	* type: Type of script (usually "text/javascript")
	* async: Allows asynchronous loading
	* defer: Defers execution until page load
Example:
```
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage about HTML">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, web development, tutorial">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
  <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

##### 4 body
The visible part of the document. This element contains all the content that users can see and interact with on a webpage, such as text, images, links, tables, forms, and other interactive elements.
Everything that appears in the browser window is placed within the `<body>` tags. It's the main content area of an HTML document.

The `<body>`  element can have attributes but are deprecated and should be avoided. Modern styling should be done using CSS instead.
* bgcolor: Sets background color (deprecated)
* text: Sets text color (deprecated)
* link: Sets link color (deprecated)
* vlink: Sets visited link color (deprecated)
* alink: Sets active link color (deprecated)


Example:
```
<body>
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p>This is visible content.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample image">
  <a href="page.html">Link to another page</a>
  <div class="container">
    <p>More content here</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

##### 5. HTML Document Structure Questions
1. What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration in an HTML document?
2. Which attribute should be used in the `<html>` element to specify the language of the document content?
3. What does the lang attribute in the `<html>` element help with for accessibility and SEO?
4. What are three important meta tags that should be included in the `<head>` section for proper web page optimization?
5. Which element contains the visible content of an HTML document that users can see and interact with?
6. What is the difference between a document type declaration and an HTML element?
7. Why is it important to include the viewport meta tag in the `<head>` section of a responsive webpage?
8. What are two deprecated attributes that were once used in the `<body>` element for styling purposes?
9. How do you specify the character encoding in an HTML document using the `<head>` section?
10. What is the significance of placing all metadata within the `<head>` section rather than the` <body>` section?

#### b. HTML Text and Headings
##### 1. Headings (h1 to h6)

source code - https://github.com/kronosGR/Tutorials/tree/main/HTML/2b


Headings in HTML are used to define the structure and hierarchy of content on a webpage. There are six heading levels, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important). These headings should be used in a logical order to create a proper document outline that helps both users and search engines understand the content structure.

* Semantic Importance
The heading hierarchy is crucial for accessibility and SEO. Screen readers rely on this hierarchy to navigate through content, and search engines use it to understand the page's content organization. Each heading level should be used once per page in a logical sequence (h1 → h2 → h3 → etc.), though multiple H2s are acceptable.

* Common Attributes
	- id: Allows linking to specific sections of the page using anchor links
	- class: For CSS styling and JavaScript manipulation
	- title: Provides additional information on hover (though not widely used)
	- lang: Specifies language for internationalization
	- dir: Sets text direction (ltr or rtl)

Example
```
<h1>Primary Heading - Main Topic</h1>
<h2>Secondary Heading - Major Section</h2>
<h3>Tertiary Heading - Subsection</h3>
<h4>Fourth Level Heading</h4>
<h5>Fifth Level Heading</h5>
<h6>Sixth Level Heading</h6>

```

##### 2. Paragraphs (p)
Paragraphs are used to group blocks of text together. They represent a complete thought or idea and are typically rendered with spacing between them. The <p> element is a block-level element, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

* Common Attributes
	- class: For styling and JavaScript targeting
	- id: Unique identifier for linking or scripting
	- lang: Specifies language of content
	- dir: Sets text direction
	- align: Text alignment (deprecated, use CSS instead)
	- title: Tooltip text on hover

Example
```
<p>This is a paragraph of text that contains information about the topic.</p>
<p>Another paragraph with different content but same styling.</p>
```


##### 3. Hyperlinks (a)
Hyperlinks (anchors) are used to link to other web pages, sections within the same page, or external resources. They can be text-based, image-based, or any other HTML element. The <a>  tag is essential for navigation and creating a connected web experience.

* Required Attribute
	* href: Specifies the URL or destination of the link (required)

* Common Attributes
	- href: URL to link to (required)
	- title: Tooltip text that appears when hovering over the link
	- target: Where to open the linked document
		- _self: Opens in the same frame (default)
		- _blank: Opens in a new tab/window
		- _parent: Opens in the parent frame
		- _top: Opens in the full body of the window
 	- rel: Relationship between current and linked documents
		- noopener: Prevents the new page from accessing the original page's window object
		- noreferrer: Hides the referrer information
		- nofollow: Tells search engines not to follow the link
		- external: Indicates external links (not a standard but commonly used)
	- class: For styling purposes
	- id: Unique identifier for targeting
	- lang: Language of the linked content
	- dir: Text direction of the linked content
	- download: Forces download instead of navigation (HTML5)
	- ping: Specifies URLs to notify when the link is clicked (HTML5)

Example 
```
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
<a href="#section1" title="Jump to section 1">Go to Section 1</a>
<a href="document.pdf" download>Download PDF Document</a>
<a href="mailto:email@example.com">Send Email</a>
<a href="page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open in New Tab</a>

```

* Additional Link Types
	- Email links: href="mailto:email@example.com"
	- Phone links: href="tel:+1234567890"
	- Anchor links: href="#section-id" for internal page navigation
	- Relative links: href="page.html" (within the same site)
	- Absolute links: href="https://www.example.com/page.html"
 
* Considerations
	- Accessibility:
		- Use descriptive link text instead of generic phrases like "click here"
		- Include meaningful titles for links
		- Ensure links are distinguishable from surrounding text
		- Consider using ARIA labels for complex navigation
	- Styling:
	  CSS properties commonly used with links include:
	  	- color: Sets text color
		- text-decoration: Controls underlines and other decorations
		- font-weight: Makes links bold if needed
		- cursor: Changes cursor to pointer on hover
transition: Smooths hover effects

```

* Headings and Paragraphs
The page uses `<h1>` to `<h3>` heading tags to structure its content and create a clear hierarchy. The `<h1>` tag defines the main title of the page ("A Quick Guide to HTML Basics"), which is the most important heading. Subsequent `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags are used for subheadings to logically break up the content into sections ("Organizing Your Content with Headings" and "Why Headings Matter"). This helps readers easily scan the page and understand the topic. The `<p>` tag is used for all the body text, organizing the content into readable paragraphs that are visually distinct from the headings. This separation makes the text easier to read and comprehend.

* Hyperlinks
The `<a>` (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks, which are essential for web navigation. The code includes two examples of `<a>` tags. The first links to an external website (https://developer.mozilla.org...) using the href attribute to specify the destination URL. It also has a target="_blank" attribute, which instructs the browser to open the link in a new browser tab. The second `<a>` tag links to an internal page (index.html) within the same blog project, allowing the user to navigate back to the homepage. These hyperlinks are what connect this blog post to the rest of the web, making it a functional part of the larger site.

##### 5. HTML Text and Heading Questions

#### c. Lists
HTML lists are fundamental elements for organizing and presenting related information in a structured format. They provide semantic meaning to content by indicating that items belong together in a sequence or group. Lists are essential for creating readable, accessible, and well-structured web pages.

##### 1. Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)
An unordered list is used to present items that don't have a specific order or sequence. The browser typically displays these with bullet points, but the actual styling can be customized using CSS. The `<ul>` element is a block-level element that contains one or more `<li>` (list item) elements.

* Key Characteristics
	- Items are displayed with bullet points by default
	- No numerical ordering is implied
	- Can be nested within other list elements
	- Semantic meaning indicates related items in no particular order
 
* Common Attributes
	- class: For CSS styling and JavaScript targeting
	- id: Unique identifier for the list element
	- lang: Specifies language of content
	- dir: Sets text direction (ltr or rtl)
	- title: Tooltip text on hover
	- style: Inline CSS styling
	- data-*: Custom data attributes for JavaScript manipulation
 
Example

```
<ul>
    <li>First item in the list</li>
    <li>Second item in the list</li>
    <li>Third item in the list</li>
</ul>
```

##### 2. Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)
An ordered list is used when items have a specific sequence or ranking. The browser typically displays these with numbers, letters, or other markers depending on the type attribute. Like unordered lists, `<ol>` elements contain ` <li>` elements.

* Key Characteristics
	- Items are displayed with numbering or lettering
	- Implies a specific order or sequence
	- Can be nested within other list elements
	- Semantic meaning indicates related items in a particular order
 
* Common Attributes
	- class: For CSS styling and JavaScript targeting
	- id: Unique identifier for the list element
	- lang: Specifies language of content
	- dir: Sets text direction (ltr or rtl)
	- title: Tooltip text on hover
	- style: Inline CSS styling
	- type: Defines the numbering style
		- 1 for numbers (default)
		- A for uppercase letters
		- a for lowercase letters
		- I for uppercase Roman numerals
		- i for lowercase Roman numerals
	- start: Sets the starting number for the list
	- reversed: Creates a descending order list (HTML5)
	- data-*: Custom data attributes for JavaScript manipulation
 
Example
```
<ol>
    <li>First step in the process</li>
    <li>Second step in the process</li>
    <li>Third step in the process</li>
</ol>

<ol type="A" start="5">
    <li>Item 5</li>
    <li>Item 6</li>
    <li>Item 7</li>
</ol>

```

 ##### 3. List Items (`<li>`)
List items are the individual elements within both ordered and unordered lists. Each `<li>` element represents one item in the list structure.

* Key Characteristics
	- Must be direct children of `<ul>` or `<ol>` elements
	- Can contain any HTML content including other lists
	- Can be styled independently with CSS
	- Support for nesting within other list elements
 
* Common Attributes
	- class: For CSS styling and JavaScript targeting
	- id: Unique identifier for the list item
	- lang: Specifies language of content
	- dir: Sets text direction (ltr or rtl)
	- title: Tooltip text on hover
	- style: Inline CSS styling
	- value: Sets the value of an `<li>` element in an ordered list (HTML5)
	- data-*: Custom data attributes for JavaScript manipulation

Example
```
<ul>
    <li class="highlighted" id="first-item">First item with custom styling</li>
    <li title="This is a tooltip">Item with hover text</li>
    <li>Regular list item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li value="10">Starting from number 10</li>
    <li>Next item</li>
    <li>Another item</li>
</ol>
```


##### 4. List Extras
* Nested Lists
Lists can be nested within each other to create complex hierarchical structures:
```
<ul>
    <li>First main item
        <ul>
            <li>Sub-item 1</li>
            <li>Sub-item 2
                <ol>
                    <li>Nested ordered item 1</li>
                    <li>Nested ordered item 2</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Second main item</li>
</ul>

```

* Lists Accessibility Considerations
For better accessibility:
	- Use semantic list elements to indicate relationships between items
	- Ensure nested lists are properly structured for screen readers
	- Include meaningful text within list items
	- Consider using ARIA roles if additional semantics are needed
	
* Best Practices
  	- Always use proper nesting - `<li>` elements must be direct children of `<ul>` or `<ol>`
	- Maintain logical order in ordered lists
	- Use appropriate list types for the content being presented
	- Combine lists with other HTML elements for complex layouts
	- Consider accessibility when creating lists
	- Use CSS for custom styling rather than relying on deprecated attributes

The new link is within the unordered list (`<ul>`), where a list item (`<li>`) now contains an anchor element (`<a>`). The href attribute is set to my-first-post.html, which is the filename of the new blog post. The text "My First Blog Post - HTML Basics" is the visible, clickable text for the link. This simple addition is what makes your site multi-page and navigable.

* Here is an updated HTML file, my-first-post.html,  for a blog post that now includes the lists. This code, for a file like my-first-post.html, would fit into the larger blog project.

Explanation of Added Elements
In this updated blog post, I added two types of lists to demonstrate the concepts from Chapter 2c.

The first list is an unordered list, which is created using the `<ul>` tag. This type of list is used when the order of the items is not important. In this example, it presents a simple, bulleted list of essential HTML tags. Each item in the list is defined by an `<li>` (list item) tag, which is nested inside the `<ul>` container. The browser displays these as bullet points by default.

The second list is an ordered list, created using the `<ol>` tag. This list is used when the sequence or order of the items matters. In this case, it presents a step-by-step guide for creating a blog post. The `<li>` tags inside the `<ol> `container are automatically numbered by the browser, making it clear that these are sequential steps. This provides a clean way to present instructions or rankings to the user.

 
##### 6. HTML Lists Questions

### Chapter 3 - Basic Media
#### 3a. Images (`<img>`)
The `<img>` element is a crucial HTML element used to embed images into web pages. It's an empty element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag, and its content is specified through various attributes.

##### 1. img Basic Syntax 
```
<img src="image-source.jpg" alt="description">
```

##### 2. img Essential Attributes
* src (Source) 
The src attribute specifies the path to the image file. This is the most important attribute for displaying images.

- Required: Yes
- Values: Can be a relative path, absolute URL, or data URI
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP, AVIF, etc.

  
```html
<!-- Relative path -->
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">

<!-- Absolute URL -->
<img src="https://example.com/images/logo.png" alt="Company logo">

<!-- Data URI (inline image) -->
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mP8/5+hHgAHggJ/PchI7wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" alt="Small image">
```

* alt (Alternative Text)
The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image if it cannot be displayed. This is crucial for accessibility and SEO.

* Required: Yes, for accessibility reasons
* Purpose: Describes the image content for screen readers, search engines, and when images fail to load
* Best practices: Be descriptive, concise, and relevant
```html
<!-- Descriptive alt text -->
<img src="mountain-landscape.jpg" alt="Snow-capped mountains under a blue sky with white clouds">

<!-- Empty alt for decorative images -->
<img src="decoration.png" alt="">

<!-- Important information in alt -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales growth chart showing 25% increase from Q1 to Q4">

```

##### 3. img Additional Common Attributes
* width and height
These attributes define the dimensions of the image in pixels.

- Purpose: Helps browsers allocate space before loading, preventing layout shifts
- Note: Should be used with caution as they can distort images if not proportional
```html
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Portrait" width="300" height="200">
```

* title
Provides additional information about the image when hovering over it.

- Purpose: Shows tooltip text on mouseover
- Note: Not as important for accessibility but useful for user experience
```html
<img src="icon.png" alt="Home icon" title="Go to homepage">
```

* loading
Controls how images are loaded (lazy loading).

- Values: auto, lazy, eager
- Purpose: Improves page performance by deferring non-critical image loading
  
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
```

* srcset and sizes
Used for responsive images that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

- srcset: Provides multiple image sources
- sizes: Defines the intended display size of the image in different scenarios
```html
<img srcset="small.jpg 300w,
             medium.jpg 600w,
             large.jpg 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw,
            (max-width: 600px) 50vw,
            33vw"
     src="medium.jpg" 
     alt="Responsive image">
```

* crossorigin
Controls how the browser handles cross-origin requests for images.

- Values: anonymous, use-credentials
- Purpose: Used for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) handling
```html
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" alt="Image from another domain">
```

* referrerpolicy
Controls what information is sent in the Referer header when fetching the image.

- values: no-referrer, origin, unsafe-url, etc.
  
```html
<img src="image.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Image with no referrer">
```

##### 4. Image Formats and Best Practices
