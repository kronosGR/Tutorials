### Chapter 3 - Basic Media
#### 3b. Video  (`<video>`): For embedding video files.
##### 1. What is the `<video>` Element?
The `<video>` element is an HTML5 semantic element used to embed video content directly into web pages without requiring third-party plugins like Flash. It provides a standardized way to display videos that works across all modern browsers.

* Basic Syntax and Structure
  
```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

##### 2. Video Common Attributes
###### Essential Attributes
* src
Specifies the URL of the video file to embed.
```html
<video src="example.mp4"></video>
```

* controls

```html
<video src="movie.mp4" controls></video>
```

* width and height
Sets the dimensions of the video player.
```html
<video src="movie.mp4" width="640" height="480"></video>
```

###### Media Control Attributes
* autoplay

```html
<video src="movie.mp4" autoplay></video>
```

* loop
Specifies that the video should loop when it reaches the end.
```html
<video src="movie.mp4" loop></video>
```

* muted
Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted.
```html

```

```html	
<video src="movie.mp4" preload="metadata"></video>
```

###### Advanced Attributes
* poster
Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading, or until the user hits the play button.
```html
<video src="movie.mp4" poster="thumbnail.jpg"></video>
```

* playsinline
For iOS Safari, this attribute allows videos to play inline instead of fullscreen.
```html
<video src="movie.mp4" playsinline></video>
```

##### 3.  Multiple Video Sources
The `<video>` element supports multiple `<source>` elements to provide different video formats for compatibility:

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

##### 4. Video Format Support
Common Video Formats:
1. MP4 - Most widely supported, especially with H.264 codec
2. WebM - Open format, good for Chrome and Firefox
3. Ogg - Open format, supported by Firefox and Opera
4. MOV - Apple's format, less common

* Browser Support Matrix
  
```
Format	Chrome	Firefox	Safari	Edge
MP4		‚úì		‚úì		‚úì		‚úì
WebM	‚úì		‚úì		‚úó		‚úì
Ogg		‚úó		‚úì		‚úó		‚úó
```

##### 5. Video Element Events
The `<video>` element supports various JavaScript events for interactive control:
- loadstart: When loading of the video starts
- canplay: When enough data is available to start playing
- playing: When video starts playing
- pause: When video is paused
- ended: When video reaches the end
- error: When an error occurs

##### 6. Accessibility Considerations
Provide captions: Use `<track>` element for subtitles
Descriptive text: Include alternative content for screen readers
Keyboard navigation: Ensure controls are accessible via keyboard
```html
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track kind="captions" src="captions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

##### 7. SEO Benefits
1. Structured data: Use schema.org markup for videos
2. Descriptive metadata: Include relevant keywords in video titles and descriptions
3. Fast loading: Properly optimized videos improve page speed scores

##### 8. Performance Optimization Tips
1. Choose appropriate formats: MP4 for broad compatibility, WebM for modern browsers
2. Compress videos: Reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality
3. Use responsive design: Make videos adapt to different screen sizes
4. Implement lazy loading: Load videos only when needed
5. Provide multiple resolutions: Offer different quality versions

##### 9. Common Use Cases
1. Product demonstrations: Show products in action
2. Tutorials and how-tos: Educational content
3. Marketing videos: Promotional material for businesses
4. Live streaming: Real-time video content
5. Background videos: Decorative video backgrounds (use carefully)

##### 10. Browser Compatibility
The `<video>` element is supported in all modern browsers:

- Chrome 4+
- Firefox 3.5+
- Safari 4+
- Internet Explorer 9+
- Edge 12+

##### 11. Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. Video not playing: Check file paths and formats
2. Autoplay blocked: Most browsers block autoplay with sound
3. Mobile compatibility: Use playsinline for iOS devices
4. Cross-origin issues: Handle CORS properly for external videos
5. Performance problems: Optimize video files and use appropriate preload settings

##### 12. Project additions for the chapter
To include a video in your project, you'll need to create a new video file and update the my-first-post.html file.

```html
 <video width="640" height="360" controls>
        <source src="video1" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
```
File Changed: The my-first-post.html file is updated to include the `<video>` element, which embeds the video into the blog post. This tag uses the src attribute to specify the video file's location. The controls attribute is added to provide a play/pause button, volume control, and other standard video player functions.
