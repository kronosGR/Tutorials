### Chapter 2 - Essential Elements
#### a. Document Structure
##### 1. DOCTYPE html
The document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in. For HTML5, it's simply `<!DOCTYPE html>`. 
This declaration must be the very first line of an HTML document and is case-insensitive. 
It ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode rather than quirks mode. 
While not an actual HTML element, it's crucial for proper page rendering and compatibility across different browsers.

The DOCTYPE declaration is essential because it tells the browser to use the modern HTML5 standard instead of legacy modes that might cause inconsistent rendering. 
Without it, some browsers may enter quirks mode where they try to emulate older browser behaviors.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>My Page</title></head>
<body><h1>Hello World</h1></body>
</html>
```

##### 2.  html
The root element of an HTML document. This is the parent element that contains all other elements in the page.
 Every HTML document must have one `<html>` element, and it should be the direct child of the document.
It's often called the "root" or "parent" element because all other elements are descendants of this element.

The `<html>` element can have several important attributes:
* lang: Specifies the primary language of the document content (e.g., lang="en" for English, lang="es" for Spanish)
* xml:lang: Specifies the language for XML documents (used in XHTML)
* dir: Specifies the text direction ("ltr" for left-to-right, "rtl" for right-to-left)
  
Example:
```
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

##### 3 head
The container for metadata about the document.
This section contains information about the page that is not visible to visitors, such as the title, character set, stylesheets, scripts, and other meta information.
Elements inside the `<head>` are not displayed on the web page itself but provide important information to browsers, search engines, and other web services.

Common attributes for elements within head:
* `<title>`: Contains the title of the document (shown in browser tab)
* `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the HTML document
	* charset: Specifies character encoding (e.g., charset="UTF-8")
	* name: Defines the type of metadata (description, keywords, author, viewport)
	* content: The value for the metadata defined by the name attribute
* `<link>`: Defines relationships between the document and external resources
	* rel: Relationship type (stylesheet, icon, canonical)
	* href: URL to the resource
	* type: MIME type of the linked resource
* `<script>`: Contains or references JavaScript code
	* src: URL to external script file
	* type: Type of script (usually "text/javascript")
	* async: Allows asynchronous loading
	* defer: Defers execution until page load
Example:
```
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage about HTML">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, web development, tutorial">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
  <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

##### 4 body
The visible part of the document. This element contains all the content that users can see and interact with on a webpage, such as text, images, links, tables, forms, and other interactive elements.
Everything that appears in the browser window is placed within the `<body>` tags. It's the main content area of an HTML document.

The `<body>`  element can have attributes but are deprecated and should be avoided. Modern styling should be done using CSS instead.
* bgcolor: Sets background color (deprecated)
* text: Sets text color (deprecated)
* link: Sets link color (deprecated)
* vlink: Sets visited link color (deprecated)
* alink: Sets active link color (deprecated)


Example:
```
<body>
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p>This is visible content.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample image">
  <a href="page.html">Link to another page</a>
  <div class="container">
    <p>More content here</p>
  </div>
</body>
```
